"""
Defines the core transport abstraction for Semantiva's distributed execution runtime.
The transport layer moves `(data, context)` payloads between orchestrators and workers,
enabling pluggable, high-performance messaging (in-memory, NATS, Kafka, etc.).

Key concepts:
  - Message: encapsulates payload, context metadata, and an optional ack callback.
  - Subscription: sync/async iterable over incoming messages with lifecycle control.
  - SemantivaTransport: abstract interface for connecting, publishing, and subscribing.
