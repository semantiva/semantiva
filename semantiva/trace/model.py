"""Trace model (v1): stable event payloads and driver contract.

Includes:
  - NodeAddress: triplet identifying a node within a specific run.
  - NodeTraceEvent: "node" envelope payload (phase, timings, errors, optional summaries).
  - TraceDriver: protocol for trace sinks; must implement start/node/end, flush, close.

Notes for consumers:
  - Switch on "type" and ignore unknown fields for forward compatibility.
  - Reserved ODO fields: plan_id (None), plan_epoch (0).
  - Orchestrator may pass ``pipeline_input`` to ``on_pipeline_start``; drivers may ignore.
